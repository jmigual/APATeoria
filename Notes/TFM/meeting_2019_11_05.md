# Meeting 2019-11-05

In this meeting we met together Geoffrey, Paris and me in order to explain to Paris all the formulation regarding Fixed Priority Gang Scheduling.

During the discussion an idea came regarding the scheduling of some tasks. When computing $LFT_i$ we have $t_{wc}$ and $t_{high}$ but for $t_{high}$ we are assuming that we have to start before the higher priority task can start. 

However, if we have a higher priority job $J_i$ and a lower priority job $J_j$ and we want to obtain $LFT_j$ when computing $t_{high}$ if $J_i$ has been released but $A^{max}_{s_i^{min}}$ is higher than $r_j$ then $t_{high}$ would give a higer value. This assumption is pessimistic as if in this case if $s_i^{min} \le s_j^{max}$ then that means that if $J_j$ can start so does $J_i$ and, since $J_i$ has a higher priority, then $J_j$ would never execute in this scenario.
