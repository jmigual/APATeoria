# Meeting 2020-02-18

## Presentation questions

- I want to have a research statement
- I want to highlight what I want new
- Limited-Preemptive slide:
  - Rigid: Same height job
  - Bundled: Sequence of jobs with different height
  - LP: Adapt the jobs so every job is a moldable job

- Every slide should bring you closer to our objective.
  - How do we want to achieve it?
- Related work:
  - There is not a clear message, make it more clear and show the "limitations"
  - Compare it with what we did
- Spend more time in the scheduling algorithm
  - Make the algorithm more dynamic
- Schedule abstraction graph
  - Explain the objective before
  - Change "Schedulability Analysis" to "Schedule Abstraction Graph"

## Results

- Send what I have to Geoffrey as soon as I have them
- Remove randomness
  - Then we can compare
  - Schedulability ratio with a varying parameter
- Search for good set of periods
  - Paper of Mitra and Bjorn where they use $x \cdot 10^y$ periods
  - Page 17 of Geoffrey's paper
  - Reference 21. Period of task in the automotive demands

## Presentation

- Slide 12 Left drawing
  - One big job rigid. Remove orange jobs
  - In bundled you ca be preemptied between bundles
  - We want to schedule each bundle as moldable were you can be preemptied between bundles
- Related work:
  1. Show gang is not predictable/sustainable
  2. Most is focused in fully preemptive
  3. We are focused in limited-preemptive to extract the full potential of loading data
- Slide 5
  - Why is gang interesting?
  - There is a reason of gang
- **Use the picture to explain**. The text is just a conclusion of what I've just said
- Slide 4
  - Introduce the example in a better way
    - Take time to explain the example. The example explains to improvements
      - Jobs take longer because they are competing for resources
      - Jobs are loading the data twice while it could be avoided
- Slide 8
  - In this work we are focusing in moldable gang
- Slide 11
  - Summarizing
- Slide 14
  - Explain every state
  - Will encode every core availability after execution
- Slide 15
  - Make it more clean
  - Explain the new challenge
  - Link it with what we were explaining
  - Remove the state-space explosion
- Slide 16
  - What is new?
  - Notion of number of cores next on "p"
  - Explain $EST_i^p \le LST_i^p$
  - Use another letter for $A_p^{\min}$  instead of $p$
- Add slide explaining JLFP at beginning of section
- Add transition slide for new scheduler
- Dry run on Wednesday 19th of February, 2020
- Title slide
  - Add logos of everyone
