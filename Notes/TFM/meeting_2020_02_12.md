# Meeting 2020-02-12

## Types of results that can be checked

- Check if giving more cores reduces execution
- Worst Case Response Time
  - Compare the difference between JLPF and LPMEGS
    - Obtain std
    - Get quartiles
    - Average increase of those that increase
    - Average decrease of those that decrease
    - Proportion that increase
- We can vary
  - Number of cores
  - Number of tasks
  - Utilization

**Start testing with rigid first** and then give elasticity

- Possible way of generating tasks: Take 2 task sets with same number of tasks and different utilization and take the minimum and maximum cores defined

## Problems regarding implementation

- For $A_{cores\ reserved}^{\max}$
  - Try to use a smart data structure
  - Use information from the previous scheduling step
  - At most 1 job will enter or leave (that may not be exactly true but not many jobs are going to be scheduled at once that's also true)

## Visualization in order to debug

- Ask Jeroen Oweneel for his visualizer. Additionally
  - Greg and Fanis where using kernel shark
    - Junaid is playing around with Kernel shark
- Alessandro Biandro is working in a visualizer. Put Geoffrey in CC

## Brussels presentation

- Send it by Friday
- Follow the guidelines for MSc students that Mitra sent
- Check the level of detail
- Important chapters
  - Introduction:
    - Challenges
    - Type of solution
  - Formalization of the problem
  - Explanation of solution
  - Results
- Tell it as a **one long story**
- Number of slides proportional to the time
- Make 15 slides more or less and very graphical
- They should be aware of the problem and the way we are solving it
- We have to show that **it's an interesting problem**
