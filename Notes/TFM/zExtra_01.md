# Extra 1: Measurement-based performance evaluation

- For safety systems, the systems should not rely on unreliable connections and should evaluate the safety by themselves

> Not every goal will be achieved by measurement alone

## Metrics

Types:

- A count of how many times an event occurs
- Duration of some time interval
- Size of some parameter

## Measuring Time: Practical Considerations
