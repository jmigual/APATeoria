# Lesson 4 - Online scheduling of aperiodic tasks

Buttazzo's book, chapter 3

### Recall: Absolute vs relative deadline

- $d_i$ Absolute deadline. The exact time where the task should be finished
- $D_i$ Relative deadline 

$$D_i = d_i - a_i$$

> **Maximum lateness**: $L_{\max} = \max\{L_i | \forall \tau_i\}$
> 
> If $L_{\max} \le 0, there is no deadline miss

## Online scheduling algorithms for real-time systems

### Earliest deadline first (EDF)
Order the ready queue by increasing the absolute deadline.

- Assumptions
    - Horn's algorithm is preeemptive and is for independent tasks
    - dynamic ($d_i$ depends on the **activation time** of the task)

- Property
    - Under the assumption above, EDF minimizes maximum lateness

> How can we design an online test for EDF that tells if we can safely add a new task to the system at time $t$?


Sometimes there can be a tie and we have to find a way to break the tie consistently.

## EDF optimality

> An algorithm $A$ is **optimal** in the sense of feasibility if it generates a feasible schedule, if there exists one

The schedule generated by EDF is feasible

## Dertouzos Transformation

- $\sigma(t) =$ task executing at time $t$
- $E(t) =$ task with the minimum $d$ at time $t$
- $t_E =$ time at which task $E$ is executed 

It preserves schedulability because:
- For the advanced slice is obvious
- For the postponed slice, the slack cannot decrease because the deadline of the postponed task MUST
