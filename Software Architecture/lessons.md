# Lesson 2

## Stakeholders
### The Architect in Scrum

 - The architect role is to avoid technical debt.
 - However there is an important management part.

### The Architect on GitHub
 - Analyse how people work on GitHub
 - Integrator: Makes the decision in what to merge

## Views
### Kruchten's "4+1 Views"

 - Logical View
 - Implementation View
 - Process View
 - Deployment View
 + Context View

### Viewpoints
Chapter 3

A collection of patterns, templates and conventions for constructing one type of view. 7 viewpoints are recognised in the book.

There are alternative catalogs for viewpoints.

## Context View

Describes the relationships, dependencies, and interactions between the system and its environment. 

You can make pictures out of this. It was done in the previous years.

> "Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context".

### Concerns
 - System scope and responsibilities
 - External entities, services, data
    - Their nature and characteristics
    - Their identity and responsibilities
 - Impact of system on its development
    - Completeness, coherence and consistency of overall end-to-end solution.

### Models
 - UML / "boxes and arrows"
    - System itself is "black box" in context
 - Interaction scenarios (chapter 10)

## Development view
Describes the architecture that supports

Show the bigger modules and how they are connected with other bigger packages. Show how the layers call each other and interact.

> "Things to think about include... system wide design constraints and 
> system-wide integrity"

### Fred Brooks: Conceptual integrity
 - Adding manpower to a late project makes it later. The people doing useful things now has to train new people that do not know anything about the project.
 - Conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.
 - "This is the underlying, defining idea that binds everything together."

### Concerts
 - Module organisation
 - Common processing
 - Standardization of design
 - Standardization of testing
 - Instrumentation
 - "Codeline organization"

### Conceptual versus Concrete
Architecture "as it is" versus architecture as "how it was designed"

 - Try to collect information on both
 - Try to contrast the two

## ISO Software Quality Characteristics
 - Maintainability
 - Usability
 - Security
 - Portability
 - Reliability
 - etc.

### Realizing Quality Attributes
- An architecture must realize the required quality attributes

An architectural perspective is a collection of architectural activities, tactics and guidelines

There are many characteristics. There's a table in the slides.

### The Evolution Perspective

The ability of the system to be flexible in the face of change balanced against the cost of providing such flexibility.

## Required content
- Stakeholder analysis and context view
- Development view
- Technical deb analysis
- _Other_ thing

# Lesson 4

## How do you make software architecture?

- Select a problem
- Generate alternate solutions
- Select best alternative

Who is at the core of generating and selecting best alternatives?

## Consequences
The consequences of not well organized people can be:

- Negatively influences code
- Affects development and operations
- Lost time and cost
- Architecture erosion

## Why you should know?

Why should we know about Software Architecture?

- Student in SA class
- Future architect
- Future developer, project manager...
- Everyday decision-making

## People at the center stage
- How decisions are reached?
- How decisions are implemented
- Role of external factors
- Evolution of architecture


## How decisions are reached? - individual
- Work habits of experts
- Designers put personal bias in design solution
- Personality characteristics
