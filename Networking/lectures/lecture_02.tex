\section{Graph metrics}

What is essential on the graph?

Types of properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Local: property of the surrounding node
  \item Global: characteristic of the entire graph
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Graph metrics}
\subsubsection{Degree}

Degree $d_j$ of node $j$: number of neighbours of $j$

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[state] (1) {1};
    \node[state, right = 2 of 1] (3) {3};
    \node[state, below right = of 1] (2) {2};
    \node[state, below right = of 3] (4) {4};
    \node[state, below = 2 of 1] (6) {6};
    \node[state, below = 2 of 3] (5) {5};

    \draw[-]    (1)   edge    (3)
                      edge[bend right]    (2)
                      edge    (6)
                (2)   edge[bend left]     (6)
                      edge[bend left]     (5)
                      edge    (3)
                (5)   edge    (4)
                      edge[bend left]     (6)
                (4)   edge    (3);
                    
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

$$
\sum_{j=1}^N d_j = 2L
$$

Average degree in $\mathcal{G}$ equals:
$$
E[D] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N d_j = \frac{2L}{N}
$$

Bounds (connected graph):
$$
2 - \frac{2}{N} \le E[D] \le N-1
$$

$$
L(K_N) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
  N \\ 2
\end{pmatrix} = \frac{N (N-1)}{2}
$$

Degree vector (row sum A): $d = Au$
\begin{itemize}
  \item Coordinate representation of the vector: $u = (1, 1, ..., 1)$
  \item Matrix representation of the vector $u^T = [1 1 ... 1]$. A vector in $m$ dimensions is
  a $m \times 1$ matrix (elements in a column)
\end{itemize}

\emph{Basic law of the degree}:
$$
u^T d = 2L \xRightarrow{thus} u^Td = u^T Au = 2L
$$

\begin{itemize}
  \item At least two nodes in G have the same degree
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A degree $N-1$ node excludes the existence of a zero degree node
  \end{itemize}
  \item The number of nodes with \textbf{odd} degree is \textbf{even}
\end{itemize}

You can also create a histogram plotting all the degrees. This allows you to have the average
and the variance of the degrees (slide 6).

Example: degree of an airport
The probability is almost linear in a log scale. It has been found that many real life problems
have an almost linear degree distribution.
$$
Pr[D_{\text{Air}} = k] \sim k^{-1.21}
$$

Internet:
$$
Pr[D_{\text{Internet}} = k] \sim k^{-\tau}, \quad \tau \in (2.2, 2.5)
$$

Many networks have a power law degree distribution (scale-free networks)

\subsubsection{Clustering coefficient}
The degree can be seen as a global metric. This one goes a bit step further.

The clustering coefficient of node $v$ is 
$$
c_G(v) = \frac{2y}{d_v(d_v - 1)} = \frac{y}{y_{max}}
$$

where $y$ is the number of links between neighbors and 
$
y_{max} = \begin{pmatrix}
  d_v \\ 2
\end{pmatrix}
$

This number tells you how connected your environment is. The clustering coefficient of a graph G:
$$
c_G = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{v = 1}^N c_G(v)
$$

\subsubsection{Adjacency matrix A and walks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Walk of length $k$ from node $i$ to $j$: succession of $k$ links (arcs)
  $n_0 \rightarrow n_1)(n_1 \rightarrow n_2) ... (n_{k-1} \rightarrow n_k)$ where $n_0 = i$ and
  $n_k = j$.
  \item Path: a walk in which all nodes/vertices are different
  \item Number of $k$-hop walks between node $i$ and $j$: $(A^k)_{ij}$
  \item Total number of $k$-hop walks in G: $N_k = u^T A^k u = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N (A^k)_{ij}$
  \item Total number of closed $k$-hop walks in G:
  $$
  W_k = \sum_{j=1}^N (A^k)_{jj} = \text{trace}(A^k)
  $$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Weight of a path P}
Consider a weighted graph, where each link $l$ has a link weight $w_l$.

The weight of a path P is defined as:
$$
w(P) = \sum_{l \in P} w_l
$$

where $l = n_i \rightarrow n_j$ is a link in $G$ from node $n_i$ to $n_j$ and part of the path
$P = (n_0 \rightarrow n_1)(n_01 \rightarrow n_2)...(n_i \rightarrow n_j)...(n_{h-1} \rightarrow n_h)$
The path $P = P_{n_0 \rightarrow n_h}$ from node $n_0$ to $n_h$ consists of $h$ \emph{different, 
consecutive} links

\subsubsection{Hopcount}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hopcount of a path $P$ is $h(P) = \sum_{l \in P} 1$, this link weight $w_l = 1$. 
  \item Hopcount from node $i$ to node $j$: 
  $H_{i \rightarrow j} = \min_{P_{i \rightarrow j}} h(P_{i \Rightarrow j}) 
  = h(P_{i \rightarrow j}^{*})$ where $P_{i \rightarrow j}^*$ is the shortest hop path from
  $i$ to $j$
\end{itemize}
