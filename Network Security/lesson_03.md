# Lesson 3 - Physical layer


## Types of connections

- Oceanic fiber: cheaper because you don't have to cross a country
- Satellite connection
- Microwave links: cheaper when you cannot put a cable in the land
- Laser:
    - Anybody in the middle can look at the data
- Power line communication
- Underground copper/fiber cables
- Cellular networks
- Wifi
- Bluetooth/LPPAN

## Ethernet security

Building an ethernet wiretap is as easy as just plugin the cables in the middle and then plugin them in your computer. There are even ethernet wiretaps solutions. 

But, if something is glued into the network it can be seen. 
The time it takes to travel for a signal into the cable is:

$$
Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
$$

So, actually, if someone is tapped into your network this can be seen by a reflection going partially back.

However, another tap can be done by detecting the magnetic field from the cable.
